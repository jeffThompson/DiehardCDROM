This CDROM contains 4.8 billion random bits in sixty 10-megabyte files,
                 bit.01, bit.02,...,bit.60.
They are a combination of some of the best deterministic random number 
generators with three commercial devices that claim to produce true randomness.
There are three approx. 10 meg  files of typical output from those devices:
              canada.bit   germany.bit   calif.bit.
They fail to meet the stringent requirements of DIEHARD: a battery of tests
of randomness, files for which are also included on this CDROM.

But the sixty 10-meg files bit.01,...,bit.60 seem to pass all tests of
randomness and independence, and they are offered here as a source for
those doing serious Monte Carlo work, who absolutely positively have to have
a reliable source of random bits.

Details of the method for producing the bits are in the postscript file
cdmake.ps.  There are three other postscript files that give further 
information.

The file structure of this CDROM is simple:  the root directory with
the sixty files of what I claim to be virtually unassailable sources
of random bits, and the three files of output from physical devices
for which claims of perfect randomness have been made, but DIEHARD refutes.

In addition, the root directory has four subdirectories:

              Subdirectory        Contents
                pscript         Four postscript files,
                                 cdmake.ps keynote.ps monkey.ps mwc1.ps
                                describing the making of this disk and
                                background theory for tests and RNG's.

                 source         Source files for DIEHARD, in C, translated
                                from Fortran files by f2c.   The DIEHARD
                                battery of tests can be constructed from
                                them, for other platforms.
